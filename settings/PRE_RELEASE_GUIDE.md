# Pre-Release Preparation Checklist

This guide helps ensure your codebase is release-ready **before** initiating the release process. Use this as a pre-flight checklist to catch issues early and streamline the actual release.

## üéØ When to Use This Guide

**Use PRE_RELEASE_GUIDE.md when:**
- You're planning a release in the next 1-3 days
- You want to validate release readiness before starting the release workflow
- You need to identify blockers or technical debt before committing to a release
- You want to prepare a release scope and issue list for stakeholders

**Do NOT use this guide:**
- During active release process (use RELEASE_GUIDE.md instead)
- For emergency hotfixes (skip to RELEASE_GUIDE.md)
- For post-release setup (use POST_RELEASE_GUIDE.md)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before starting pre-release checks:
1. ‚úÖ All planned features/fixes for this release are complete
2. ‚úÖ All development branches have been merged
3. ‚úÖ You have time for a full test cycle (1-2 hours minimum)
4. ‚úÖ You know what type of release this will be (MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH)

## üîç Pre-Release Validation Checklist

### **Phase 1: Code Quality & Testing**

#### **1.1 Run Full E2E Test Suite**
üö® **CRITICAL:** Tests must pass BEFORE any release preparation work.

```bash
# Run complete Playwright test suite
npm run test:e2e

# If tests fail, document failures
npm run test:e2e:report
```

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All E2E tests pass
- [ ] No flaky or intermittent failures
- [ ] Test report shows 100% pass rate

**‚ùå If tests fail:**
1. Create fix branch: `git checkout -b fix/pre-release-e2e-failures`
2. Fix failing tests
3. Re-run tests until all pass
4. Merge fix branch
5. Return to this checklist

See [TESTING_WORKFLOW.md](./TESTING_WORKFLOW.md) for details.

#### **1.2 Validate JavaScript Syntax**
```bash
# Check all HTML files for JavaScript syntax errors
python3 python/validate_js_syntax.py

# Check for common issues
python3 python/find_hardcoded_strings.py
```

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] No JavaScript syntax errors
- [ ] No hardcoded strings (all use TEXT_CONSTANTS)

#### **1.3 Manual Functional Testing**
Open `en/index.html` in browser and verify:

**Dashboard Tab:**

- [ ] Parse button processes data without errors
- [ ] Statistics display correctly
- [ ] Export buttons work (Copy Stats, Export CSV)

**Timeline Tab:**
- [ ] Charts render correctly
- [ ] Zoom/pan controls work
- [ ] Time grouping selector works
- [ ] Vertical stake line aligns properly (Issue #148)

**Analysis Tab:**
- [ ] Query aggregation works
- [ ] Sorting and filtering function correctly
- [ ] Modal dialogs open with correct data

**Every Query Tab:**
- [ ] All queries display
- [ ] Search/filter works
- [ ] Individual query details accessible

**Index/Query Flow Tab:**
- [ ] Flow diagrams render
- [ ] Panzoom works correctly
- [ ] Performance highlighting displays

- [ ] All interactive elements respond correctly
- [ ] No visual glitches or layout issues
- [ ] Copy/paste functionality works across all features

### **Phase 2: Version & Documentation Review**

#### **2.1 Check Current Version Status**
```bash
# Verify current version across all files
echo "=== AGENT.md Version ==="
grep "Current Version" AGENT.md

echo "=== index.html Version ==="
grep "name=\"version\"" index.html

echo "=== en/index.html Version ==="
grep "APP_VERSION" en/index.html | head -1

echo "=== en/index.html Header Comment ==="
grep -A 1 "Version:" en/index.html | head -2

echo "=== Dockerfile Version ==="
grep "version=" Dockerfile
```

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All files show consistent version number
- [ ] Version format is valid (X.X.X or X.X.X-post)
- [ ] No mismatch between files

**Document your findings:**
- Current Version: `________________`
- Is this a `-post` version? `[ ] Yes [ ] No`

#### **2.2 Check for Dev Build Artifacts**
```bash
# Check for development build banner
grep -n "DEV BUILD BANNER" index.html en/index.html

# Check for -post suffix in versions
grep -E "version.*-post" index.html en/index.html AGENT.md
```

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] No dev banner present (or note that it needs removal)
- [ ] No `-post` suffix in versions (or note that it needs removal)

**If found, document for release:**
- [ ] Dev banner removal needed before release
- [ ] `-post` suffix removal needed before release

#### **2.3 Review Release Notes**
```bash
# Check release_notes.md exists and is current
cat release_notes.md
```

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] `release_notes.md` exists
- [ ] Most recent entry matches current development work
- [ ] All recent GitHub issues/PRs are documented
- [ ] Release notes are user-friendly and clear

**If outdated:**
- [ ] Add missing release notes now (don't wait for release day)
- [ ] Reference GitHub issues: https://github.com/Fujio-Turner/cb_completed_request/issues

#### **2.4 Verify Documentation Consistency**
```bash
# Check AGENT.md is current
head -20 AGENT.md

# Check README.md links work
grep -n "release_notes.md" README.md
```

**‚úÖ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] AGENT.md header shows correct current version
- [ ] AGENT.md instructions are current
- [ ] README.md links to release_notes.md
- [ ] All cross-references between docs are valid

### **Phase 3: GitHub & Issue Review**

## üìö Next Steps

**If GO FOR RELEASE:**

2. Follow [RELEASE_GUIDE.md](RELEASE_GUIDE.md) for release execution
3. Keep this pre-release checklist for release log reference

**If NO-GO FOR RELEASE:**
1. Create fix branches for identified issues
2. Document deferred issues for next release
3. Re-run this checklist when ready
