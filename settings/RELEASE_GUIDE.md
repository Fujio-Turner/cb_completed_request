# Complete Release Guide for Couchbase Query Analyzer

This guide orchestrates a full release process by combining all other guides and the release logging system. Use this guide when you want to create a new version release that includes version updates, localization updates, and complete documentation.

## 🎯 When to Use This Guide

**Use RELEASE_GUIDE.md when:**
- Creating a new version release (MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH)
- You want to update versions AND ensure all localizations are current
- You need a complete release with full documentation and testing
- You want a comprehensive log of all changes made

**Use individual guides when:**
- Testing version updates without localization ([VERSION_UPDATE_GUIDE.md](VERSION_UPDATE_GUIDE.md))
- Testing localization without version changes ([LOCALIZATION_GUIDE.md](LOCALIZATION_GUIDE.md))
- Making isolated changes to specific components

## 🔄 Complete Release Process

### Step 0: Initialize Release Log
```bash
# Create timestamped release log from template
cp settings/release.template settings/release_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt

# Open the release log file - you'll update this throughout the process
```

**📝 CRITICAL:** Keep your release log file open and update it after each major step. This creates a permanent record of your release process.

### Step 1: Determine Version Number  
First, calculate what version number you'll be releasing:

1. **Open:** [VERSION_CALCULATION_GUIDE.md](VERSION_CALCULATION_GUIDE.md)
2. **Analyze Git History:** Check for recent issue-related merges using the git commands in the guide
3. **Read GitHub Issues:** Review issues at https://github.com/Fujio-Turner/cb_completed_request/issues for context on recent fixes/features
4. **Complete:** Full change analysis and version calculation with issue references
5. **Document:** Your version decision, reasoning, and GitHub issue links
6. **Result:** You should have your old and new version numbers ready with issue-based context

### Step 2: Follow VERSION_UPDATE_GUIDE.md
Execute the complete version update process:

1. **Open:** [VERSION_UPDATE_GUIDE.md](VERSION_UPDATE_GUIDE.md)
2. **Follow:** All steps from "Step 2: Update HTML Files" through "Step 5: Verification" (Step 1 is now done)
3. **Update release log:** Check off each item in the "HTML Files Updates" and "Documentation Updates" sections
4. **Important:** The VERSION_UPDATE_GUIDE already includes release log instructions

**Expected Outcome:**
- All HTML files updated with new version numbers
- All documentation (AGENT.md, README files) updated with new version
- Docker files updated with new version
- All version consistency checks passed

### Step 3: Follow LOCALIZATION_GUIDE.md
Ensure all localizations are current and complete:

1. **Open:** [LOCALIZATION_GUIDE.md](LOCALIZATION_GUIDE.md)
2. **Execute:** README Files maintenance (if needed)
3. **Execute:** HTML Tools synchronization using **COMPLETE REPLACEMENT METHOD**:
   - **Create backups** of existing localized files: `cp de/index.html de/index.html.backup`
   - **Copy en/index.html** to all language directories: `cp en/index.html de/index.html`
   - **Re-translate entire files** using translation system (do NOT try to selectively copy features)
   - **Verify functionality** is identical across all language versions
4. **Run:** Post-translation audit system to verify completeness
5. **Update release log:** Check off localization verification items

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** When new features are added to en/index.html, localized versions MUST be completely replaced and re-translated, not selectively updated.

**Expected Outcome:**
- All README files synchronized across languages with current release notes
- All HTML files have complete translations AND identical functionality 
- Translation audit shows 95%+ completion
- All language versions tested and functional
- **All language versions contain the same features as English version**

### Step 4: Comprehensive Release Testing
Using your release log file, verify all components:

#### Version Consistency Verification
Run the commands from your release log's "Version Consistency Checks" section:
```bash
grep -r "name=\"version\"" *.html
grep -r "<title>" *.html  
grep -r "version-info" *.html
grep -r "APP_VERSION" *.html
grep -r "# Couchbase Slow Query Analysis Tool" README*.md AGENT.md
```

#### Functional Testing
Test each component listed in your release log's "Functional Testing" section:
- [ ] English (index.html) loads and functions
- [ ] German (de/index.html) loads with translations
- [ ] Spanish (es/index.html) loads with translations  
- [ ] Portuguese (pt/index.html) loads with translations
- [ ] All charts display correctly
- [ ] All buttons function properly
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors

#### Localization Verification
Run the commands from your release log's "Localization Verification" section:
```bash
grep -n ">Dashboard<\|>Timeline<\|>Analysis<" de/index.html
grep -n ">Dashboard<\|>Timeline<\|>Analysis<" es/index.html
grep -n ">Dashboard<\|>Timeline<\|>Analysis<" pt/index.html
grep -n "Copy</button>" */index.html
grep -n ">Copy<\|>Show<\|>Hide<\|>Reset<" */index.html
```

### Step 5: Docker & Deployment
Complete the deployment preparation:

1. **Verify Docker files:** Check Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflow versions
2. **Plan Docker Hub cleanup:** Note old versions to remove in release log
3. **Update release log:** Complete "Docker & Deployment Updates" section

### Step 6: Final Release Documentation
Complete your release log:

1. **Fill Additional Notes:** Document any issues or special considerations, including GitHub issue references
2. **Complete Files Modified:** Check off all modified files
3. **Add GitHub Context:** Document which GitHub issues were resolved or addressed in this release
4. **Finalize Release Complete section:** Add your name and completion date
5. **Save release log:** This becomes your permanent release record with issue tracking

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If VERSION_UPDATE_GUIDE.md fails:
- Check your release log to see which step failed
- Fix the issue and resume from that step
- Update release log with notes about the problem

### If LOCALIZATION_GUIDE.md fails:
- Use the translation audit system to identify missing translations
- Update settings/translations.json if needed
- Re-run the localization process
- Document issues in release log

### If testing fails:
- Check JavaScript console for errors
- Verify file paths and references are correct
- Test each language version individually
- Document failures and fixes in release log

### If localized HTML files are missing new features:
**🚨 COMMON ISSUE:** Localized files (de/index.html, es/index.html, pt/index.html) missing functionality that exists in en/index.html

**Root Cause:** Selective feature copying instead of complete file replacement

**Solution:**
1. **Backup existing files:** `cp de/index.html de/index.html.backup` (repeat for es/ and pt/)
2. **Replace with English version:** `cp en/index.html de/index.html` (repeat for es/ and pt/)
3. **Re-translate completely:** Use translation system to translate entire file
4. **Verify feature parity:** Ensure all tabs/functionality exist in all language versions
5. **Update release log:** Document the complete replacement approach used

**Prevention:** Always use complete file replacement method when en/index.html gets new features
