# External Library Version Exclusion Guide

## Purpose
This guide documents the filters used in release verification scripts to prevent external JavaScript/CSS library versions from being flagged as "old application versions" during release checks.

## Problem Solved
External libraries (jQuery, Chart.js, etc.) have their own version numbers (e.g., jQuery 3.7.1) which were being incorrectly flagged as old application versions during release verification.

## Solution
Updated release verification scripts to exclude external library references by filtering out:

### CDN URLs
- `cdnjs.cloudflare.com` - CloudFlare CDN
- `cdn.jsdelivr.net` - JSDelivr CDN
- `code.jquery.com` - jQuery CDN

### File Patterns  
- `.min.js` - Minified JavaScript files
- `.min.css` - Minified CSS files

### HTML Attributes
- `integrity=` - Subresource Integrity hashes
- `crossorigin=` - Cross-origin attributes
- `src=` - Script source attributes
- `href=` - Link href attributes

## Updated Files

### RELEASE_WORK_CHECK.md
Updated the old version detection command:
```bash
# Before (flagged jQuery 3.7.1 as old version)
OLD_VERSIONS=$(grep -r "3\.7\.[0-1]" *.html */index.html *.md AGENT.md Dockerfile 2>/dev/null | grep -v release_ || true)

# After (ignores external libraries)
OLD_VERSIONS=$(grep -r "3\.7\.[0-1]" *.html */index.html *.md AGENT.md Dockerfile 2>/dev/null | grep -v release_ | grep -v "cdnjs.cloudflare.com" | grep -v "integrity=" | grep -v "crossorigin=" || true)
```

### RELEASE_WORK_CHECK.py
Added comprehensive external library filtering in the version consistency check:
- Filters out CDN URLs and integrity hashes
- Only reports matches that look like application versions
- Excludes minified library files

## Usage
External library updates can now be done without triggering false positives in release verification:
```html
<!-- This will NOT be flagged as an old version -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js" 
        integrity="sha512-..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<!-- This WILL be flagged if it's an old app version -->
<title>Query Analyzer v3.7.1</title>
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Accurate version verification focused on application versions
- ✅ External library updates don't break release process  
- ✅ Maintains security with integrity hash verification
- ✅ Clear distinction between app versions and dependency versions
