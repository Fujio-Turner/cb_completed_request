# Release Work Verification Tool

## Purpose
This guide provides independent verification commands to double-check that release work claimed in `release_*.txt` files was actually completed. Run these checks after any release to ensure all changes were properly applied.

## How to Use
1. **Find your release log:** `ls settings/release_*.txt` and pick the most recent one
2. **Extract claimed version:** Look for "New Version:" in the release log 
3. **Replace `{VERSION}` below** with the actual version number from your release log
4. **Run verification commands** to check if the work was really done

## üîç Version Consistency Verification

### Check HTML Files Have Correct Version (English-only)
```bash
# Expected: Both should show the same new version number
grep -H "name=\"version\"" index.html en/index.html

# Expected: Both titles should show v{VERSION}
grep -H "<title>" index.html en/index.html

# Expected: Both version-info divs should show v{VERSION}
grep -H "version-info" index.html en/index.html

# Expected: Both APP_VERSION constants should show "{VERSION}"
grep -H "APP_VERSION" index.html en/index.html
```

### Check Documentation Files
```bash
# Expected: README.md and AGENT.md should show v{VERSION} in headers
grep -H "# Couchbase Slow Query Analysis Tool" README.md AGENT.md 2>/dev/null

# Check AGENT.md version section specifically
grep -A2 -B1 "Current Version" AGENT.md
```

### Check Docker Files
```bash
# Expected: Should show LABEL version="{VERSION}"
grep "version=" Dockerfile

# Expected: Should show version tags matching new version
grep -A10 -B5 "type=raw,value=" .github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml
```

## üåê Localization Verification
Removed. Localization is no longer part of the release verification for HTML files.

---

## üìö Documentation Verification

### Check README.md Structure
```bash
# Expected: README.md should exist
echo "=== Verifying README.md exists ==="
ls -la README.md 2>/dev/null

# Check for Quick Start section (should be positioned early)
echo "=== Checking Quick Start positioning (README.md) ==="
readme=README.md
if [ -f "$readme" ]; then
  echo "--- $readme ---"
  grep -n -A2 -B2 "Quick Start" "$readme" 2>/dev/null || echo "No Quick Start found"
fi
```

### Check Release Notes Were Added
```bash
# Expected: Should find version entries with today's date pattern
echo "=== Checking for release notes entries (README.md) ==="
readme=README.md
if [ -f "$readme" ]; then
  echo "--- $readme ---"
  grep -n -A3 -B1 "v[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" "$readme" | head -10
fi
```

## üß™ Functional Verification

### Check All HTML Files Load Without Obvious Errors
```bash
# Basic syntax check - look for common HTML structure
echo "=== Basic HTML structure verification ==="
for htmlfile in index.html en/index.html; do
  if [ -f "$htmlfile" ]; then
    echo "--- $htmlfile ---"
    echo "Has DOCTYPE: $(grep -c DOCTYPE "$htmlfile")"
    echo "Has html tag: $(grep -c "<html" "$htmlfile")"
    echo "Has head tag: $(grep -c "<head>" "$htmlfile")"
    echo "Has body tag: $(grep -c "<body>" "$htmlfile")"
    echo "Has script tags: $(grep -c "<script>" "$htmlfile")"
    echo ""
  fi
done
```

### Check JavaScript Constants Are Properly Set
```bash
# Expected: All should have matching APP_VERSION and LAST_UPDATED
echo "=== JavaScript constants verification ==="
for htmlfile in index.html en/index.html; do
  if [ -f "$htmlfile" ]; then
    echo "--- $htmlfile ---"
    grep "const APP_VERSION" "$htmlfile" 2>/dev/null
    grep "const LAST_UPDATED" "$htmlfile" 2>/dev/null
    echo ""
  fi
done
```

## üîÑ Cross-Reference Verification

### Version Consistency Cross-Check
```bash
echo "=== Cross-referencing all version mentions ==="

# Get version from AGENT.md
AGENT_VERSION=$(grep "Current Version.*v" AGENT.md | grep -o "v[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" | head -1)
echo "AGENT.md version: $AGENT_VERSION"

# Get version from main README
README_VERSION=$(grep "# Couchbase.*v[0-9]" README.md | grep -o "v[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" | head -1)
echo "README.md version: $README_VERSION"

# Get version from main HTML meta tags
HTML_VERSION_ROOT=$(grep "name=\"version\"" index.html | grep -o "[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" | head -1)
HTML_VERSION_EN=$(grep "name=\"version\"" en/index.html | grep -o "[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" | head -1)
echo "index.html meta version: v$HTML_VERSION_ROOT"
echo "en/index.html meta version: v$HTML_VERSION_EN"

# Get version from JavaScript constants
JS_VERSION_ROOT=$(grep "APP_VERSION.*=" index.html | grep -o "[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" | head -1)
JS_VERSION_EN=$(grep "APP_VERSION.*=" en/index.html | grep -o "[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" | head -1)
echo "index.html APP_VERSION: v$JS_VERSION_ROOT"
echo "en/index.html APP_VERSION: v$JS_VERSION_EN"

# Get Docker version
DOCKER_VERSION=$(grep "LABEL version=" Dockerfile | grep -o "[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+" | head -1)
echo "Dockerfile version: v$DOCKER_VERSION"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ All versions should match. If they don't, the release was incomplete."
```

### File Modification Date Check
```bash
echo "=== Checking recent modification dates ==="
echo "Files modified in the last 24 hours:"
find . -name "*.html" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "Dockerfile" -o -name "*.yml" | \
  grep -v ".git" | xargs ls -lt | head -20
```

## üö® Red Flags to Look For

Run this comprehensive check to spot common release problems:

```bash
echo "üö® RED FLAG DETECTOR üö®"
echo "=========================="

# Check for version mismatches
echo "1. Checking for old version remnants..."
OLD_VERSIONS=$(grep -r "3\.7\.[0-1]" *.html */index.html *.md AGENT.md Dockerfile 2>/dev/null | grep -v release_ | grep -v "cdnjs.cloudflare.com" | grep -v "integrity=" | grep -v "crossorigin=" || true)
if [ -n "$OLD_VERSIONS" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Found old version numbers:"
  echo "$OLD_VERSIONS"
else
  echo "‚úÖ No old version remnants found"
fi

echo ""
echo "2. Checking for missing critical files..."
MISSING_FILES=""
for file in index.html en/index.html AGENT.md README.md Dockerfile; do
  if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
    MISSING_FILES="$MISSING_FILES $file"
  fi
done

if [ -n "$MISSING_FILES" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Missing critical files:$MISSING_FILES"
else
  echo "‚úÖ All critical files present"
fi

echo ""
echo "3. Checking for syntax errors in HTML..."
for htmlfile in index.html en/index.html; do
  if [ -f "$htmlfile" ]; then
    UNCLOSED_TAGS=$(grep -c "<script>" "$htmlfile" 2>/dev/null) || 0
    CLOSE_TAGS=$(grep -c "</script>" "$htmlfile" 2>/dev/null) || 0
    if [ "$UNCLOSED_TAGS" != "$CLOSE_TAGS" ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Script tag mismatch in $htmlfile: $UNCLOSED_TAGS open, $CLOSE_TAGS close"
    fi
  fi

echo ""
echo "=========================="

## üí° Usage Tips

1. **Run immediately after release:** Don't wait - verify while the work is fresh
2. **Replace {VERSION} with actual version:** The version number from your release log
3. **Save verification results:** Keep a record of what you found
4. **Fix issues before deployment:** Don't deploy if verification fails

This tool is independent of the release process and only checks final results, not what the release guides claim was done.
