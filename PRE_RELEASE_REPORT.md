**Issues Resolved in Current Development:**
- Issue #176 (in 3.24.2)
- Issue #175 (in 3.24.2)

**Action:** No blockers identified. Open issues are enhancement requests suitable for future releases.

### ‚úÖ 3.2 Recent Commits
**Status:** REVIEWED  
**Recent Activity (Last 20 commits):**
- Recent commits show ongoing development work
- Commits reference: indexes, parsing, SQL patterns, JOIN processing, hash improvements
- Last release commits: 3.24.2, 3.24.1, 3.24.0

**Commits with fix/feat keywords (last week):**
- `99ce776` - release-3.24.2
- `e361666` - 3.24.1 Post Release
- `bafae34` - release-3.24.1
- `97d1514` - release-3.24.0
- `cb00c3d` - fix join counter
- `d2f4616` - release-3.23.0
- `7999f3a` - fix lazyload

**Action:** Recent work appears incremental. Determine if current commits warrant a 3.24.3 release.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3.3 Release Scope Determination
**Status:** NEEDS DECISION  
**Recommendation:** PATCH release (3.24.3)

**Reasoning:**
- Recent commits show incremental improvements
- No breaking changes
- No major new features
- Work on indexes, parsing, JOIN processing, hash improvements
- Commits are development-focused without clear user-facing changes

**Question for User:** Are the recent commits (indexes data, JOIN processing, SQL patterns, hash improvements) ready for release, or should we wait for more substantial changes?

**Possible Alternatives:**
1. **Release 3.24.3 now** - Package recent improvements as PATCH release
2. **Wait for more changes** - Continue development until Issue #183, #182, #181 or other priorities are complete
3. **Release as 3.25.0** - If recent work includes significant new capabilities (MINOR release)

**Action Required:** User decision on release scope and timing.

---

## Phase 4: Dependency & Environment Check

### ‚úÖ 4.1 Dependencies
**Status:** PASS  
**Results:**
- Node.js version: v23.11.0 ‚úì
- npm packages: No outdated packages found ‚úì
- Playwright version: 1.56.1 ‚úì

**Action:** None required

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 4.2 Build Environment
**Status:** PASS (Docker N/A)  
**Findings:**
- Docker: Not installed/available (command not found)
- File permissions: Correct (rw-r--r--)
- Git status: Clean (only new PRE_RELEASE_GUIDE.md file)

**Files:**
- `index.html` - Modified Oct 20 22:25
- `en/index.html` - Modified Oct 20 22:54

**Action:** Docker unavailable but not critical if not using containerized builds. Proceed without Docker or install if needed for deployment.

## Recommendation

### ‚úÖ GO FOR RELEASE (Conditional)

**The codebase is technically ready for release, pending:**
1. **User decision** on whether recent changes warrant a 3.24.3 release
2. **User decision** on release timing
3. **Verification** of recent development work completeness

**If proceeding with release:**
- Follow RELEASE_GUIDE.md completely
- Pay special attention to AGENT.md versioning (fix "post-post" issue)
- Determine if recent commits warrant release notes entry
- Consider whether changes are better suited for 3.24.3 (PATCH) or 3.25.0 (MINOR)

**If NOT proceeding with release:**
- Continue development
- Focus on completing open issues (#183, #182, #181, etc.)
- Re-run PRE_RELEASE_GUIDE.md when ready

---

## Next Steps

### If GO FOR RELEASE:
1. ‚úÖ User confirms release scope and timing
2. Create release branch: `git checkout -b release/3.24.3`
3. Follow [RELEASE_GUIDE.md](settings/RELEASE_GUIDE.md)
4. Reference this report for known issues and actions

### If NO-GO FOR RELEASE:
1. Continue development on current feature branch
2. Address priority issues: #183, #182, #181, #180
3. Re-run PRE_RELEASE_GUIDE.md when ready
4. Keep this report for reference

## Questions for User

1. **Are recent commits (indexes, JOIN, SQL parsing, hash) ready for production release?**
2. **Should this be 3.24.3 (PATCH) or wait for more substantial changes?**
3. **What is the target release date?**
4. **Should we address any specific open issues before releasing?**
5. **Is the AGENT.md "3.24.2-post-post" versioning intentional or an error?**
