FUNCTIONAL:
[✅] All HTML files have proper structure (DOCTYPE/html/head/body)
[✅] JavaScript constants set correctly in language apps (APP_VERSION="3.12.2", LAST_UPDATED="2025-09-06")
[ℹ️] Main index.html is a guide/landing page and intentionally lacks APP_VERSION/LAST_UPDATED
[✅] File modification dates are recent for release artifacts

RED FLAGS:
[⚠️] Old version numbers (e.g., 3.7.0) appear in README release notes by design — acceptable

[✅] No HTML script tag mismatch detected

OVERALL RESULT:
[❌] FAIL - Localization issues detected (English button/label text in non-English files)

NOTES:
- Copy/Show/Hide/Reset and several UI strings in de/es/pt are still English. Update TEXT_CONSTANTS and button labels per Internationalization Guidelines, or re-run localization scripts to apply translations safely.
- AGENT.md, Dockerfile, workflow, and all HTML meta/JS versions are correctly updated to 3.12.2.
