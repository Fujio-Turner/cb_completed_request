- All documentation files show correct version
- Language files exist and are properly sized
- Recent modification timestamps confirm release activity
- No critical files missing

MINOR ISSUES FOUND:

2. jQuery library version references (3.7.1) are CDN versions, not app version issues
3. HTML script tag count discrepancies likely due to inline vs external script detection
4. Historical version references in README files are expected (release notes)

RECOMMENDATION:

- Technical English terms in JavaScript code (expected)
- Detection false positives for library versions vs app versions
- Historical version references in documentation

The core release objectives were met successfully.
