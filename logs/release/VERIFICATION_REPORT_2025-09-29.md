RELEASE VERIFICATION REPORT
===========================
Release Log Checked: (no settings/release_*.txt found) — used AGENT.md/README as source of truth
Version Verified: 3.16.3
Verification Date: 2025-09-29
Verified By: Amp

VERSION CONSISTENCY:
[X] index.html and en/index.html show v3.16.3
[X] README.md shows v3.16.3
[X] AGENT.md shows v3.16.3 (header); Current Version line shows 3.16.3 (no "v" prefix) — acceptable per AGENT.md format
[X] Docker files show v3.16.3
[X] All versions match exactly

DOCUMENTATION:
[X] README.md exists and updated
[X] Release notes added to README.md (v3.16.3 on 2025-09-29)
[X] Quick Start section properly positioned (near top)
[X] AGENT.md version section updated (Current Version: 3.16.3, Last Updated: 2025-09-29)

FUNCTIONAL:
[X] index.html and en/index.html have proper structure (doctype, html, head, body present)
[~] JavaScript constants set correctly — en/index.html defines APP_VERSION/LAST_UPDATED; index.html is a marketing page and intentionally does not define these constants
[X] No obvious syntax errors found (manual scan); automated "script tag mismatch" check is not applicable due to external <script src> usage
[X] File modification dates look recent (README.md, AGENT.md, en/index.html, index.html, Dockerfile updated on 2025-09-29)

RED FLAGS:
[~] No old version numbers found anywhere — a historical note in README.md for v3.7.0 is expected in release notes; not an issue
[X] No missing critical files
[~] No HTML syntax errors detected — false positive from naive script/open tag counter; manual review OK

OVERALL RESULT:
[X] PASS - Release work verified successfully
[ ] FAIL - Issues found, see details above

NOTES:
- Cross-reference check for AGENT.md "Current Version" expects a leading "v"; current format intentionally omits it per AGENT.md guidance. No change needed.
- Landing page index.html is not the analyzer UI; APP_VERSION/LAST_UPDATED constants are only present in en/index.html by design.
