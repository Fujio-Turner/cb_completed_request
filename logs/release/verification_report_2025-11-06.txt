===========================
Release Version: 3.28.1
Verification Date: 2025-11-06
Verified By: Amp AI Assistant

VERSION CONSISTENCY:
[✅] index.html shows v3.28.1 in meta version tag
[✅] en/index.html shows v3.28.1 in meta version tag and title
[✅] en/index.html APP_VERSION constant shows "3.28.1"

[✅] Dockerfile shows v3.28.1 in LABEL version
[✅] Docker workflow shows v3.28.1 and 3.28.1 tags
[✅] All versions match exactly

DOCUMENTATION:
[✅] README.md exists and updated (modified Nov 6 00:07)
[✅] README.md has Quick Start section at line 20 (properly positioned)
[✅] AGENT.md version section updated (Current Version: 3.28.1, Last Updated: 2025-11-06)
[⚠️] Release notes minimal in README.md (only shows v3.28.1 in title)

FUNCTIONAL:
[✅] index.html has proper HTML structure (DOCTYPE, html, head, body tags)
[✅] en/index.html has proper HTML structure (DOCTYPE, html, head, body tags)
[✅] en/index.html JavaScript constants set correctly (APP_VERSION = "3.28.1", LAST_UPDATED = "2025-11-06")
[⚠️] index.html does not have APP_VERSION constant (likely redirect file)
[✅] Script tags balanced: index.html (1/1), en/index.html (18/18)

RED FLAGS:
[⚠️] Old version numbers found in feature notifications (intentional - version "3.27.0" in FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS refers to when feature was added)
[⚠️] Old version numbers found in documentation files (intentional - DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md, FEATURE_NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md, OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md contain historical version references)
[✅] No missing critical files
[✅] HTML syntax appears correct (script tags balanced)

OVERALL RESULT:
[✅] PASS - Release work verified successfully

NOTES:
1. The old version "3.27.0" found in en/index.html is in the FEATURE_NOTIFICATIONS object and refers to when that feature was originally introduced, not the current version. This is intentional and correct.

2. Documentation files (DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md, FEATURE_NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md, FLOW_DIAGRAM_FEATURE_FLAG.md, OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md) contain historical version references which is expected for changelog/history tracking.

3. The index.html file appears to be a simplified redirect/landing page without the full APP_VERSION constant, while en/index.html contains the full application code.

4. All critical version markers (meta tags, titles, constants, documentation headers, Docker labels) are correctly set to v3.28.1.

5. File modification dates confirm recent updates (Nov 6).

VERIFICATION DETAILS:
- HTML meta version tags: ✅ Both show 3.28.1
- HTML titles: ✅ Both reference v3.28.1
